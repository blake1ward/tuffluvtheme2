<p><h3>At the Tuff Luv baby food factory</h3> Chef Lana Henderson sought to develop the ultimate dish: a food source that rapidly renews inside the human body.</p>

<p>The formula was difficult to master. Frustrated by her many failed attempts, the chef handled experimental Batch #37 recklessly and leaked some into the baby food supply line.</p>

<p>20 years later, one of the infected babies, now a grown ass man, is thrust into a cryptic new reality spawned by the chef's experimentation. Lime could be the final link in a ploy to end suffering on a worldwide scale, but what is right and just gets blurred in the experimental underbelly of the culinary world.<p>
